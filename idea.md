# HireLens AI – Intelligent Resume to Job Matching Platform

## 1. Problem Statement

Recruiters receive a very large number of resumes for every job opening.  
Manual resume screening is:

- time consuming
- inconsistent between recruiters
- highly dependent on keyword matching
- not able to improve based on past hiring decisions

Most existing Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) only perform simple keyword search and do not learn from recruiter feedback.

There is a need for a system that can:
- understand resumes and job descriptions semantically
- rank candidates using multiple factors
- continuously improve matching quality using feedback.

---

## 2. Project Objective

To build a full-stack platform that:

- processes resumes and job descriptions
- extracts structured information
- generates semantic representations
- matches candidates to jobs
- ranks candidates
- captures recruiter feedback
- adapts its scoring strategy over time

The primary focus of this project is backend architecture, system design and business logic.

## 3. Actors

### Candidate
A user who uploads a resume and views job-matching feedback.

### Recruiter
A user who uploads job descriptions, views ranked candidates and provides feedback.

### Admin
A system administrator who monitors performance and controls scoring configurations.

---

## 4. Functional Scope

### 4.1 Authentication and Role Management

- Users can register and log in.
- Role based access is enforced (Candidate / Recruiter / Admin).

---

### 4.2 Resume Processing Module

Candidate uploads a resume in PDF format.

System performs:
- text extraction
- skill extraction
- experience summary extraction
- embedding generation for semantic representation

A structured resume profile is stored in the database.

---

### 4.3 Job Description Processing Module

Recruiter submits job description text.

System performs:
- extraction of required skills
- extraction of experience level
- generation of semantic embedding

A structured job profile is stored.

---

### 4.4 Matching and Ranking Module

For a selected job:

- all eligible resumes are retrieved
- similarity scores are computed
- weighted scoring is applied using:
  - skill overlap
  - experience relevance
  - semantic similarity
- candidates are ranked

---

### 4.5 Recruiter Feedback Module

Recruiter can mark a candidate as:

- relevant
- not relevant
- shortlisted
- rejected

This feedback is stored for learning purposes.

---

### 4.6 Adaptive Scoring Module

The system periodically analyses:

- historical match results
- recruiter feedback patterns

The system updates internal scoring weights used during ranking.

Previous scoring configurations are preserved for reproducibility.

---

### 4.7 Candidate Feedback Module

Candidate can view:
- match summary
- missing skills
- improvement suggestions generated by AI

---

## 5. Out of Scope

- interview scheduling
- chat or messaging
- onboarding and offer management

---

## 6. Technology Stack

Frontend:
- React

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

AI utilities:
- text extraction
- embedding generation
- suggestion generation

---

## 7. Architecture

The backend follows:

- Controller – Service – Repository architecture
- Domain engines for complex logic

Major layers:
- Controllers
- Services
- Domain engines
- Repositories
- Data models

---

## 8. Design Principles

- Encapsulation of business logic inside services and domain engines
- Abstraction between API layer and domain logic
- Inheritance for user roles
- Polymorphism for scoring strategies
- SOLID principles

---

## 9. Success Criteria

- Clean backend structure
- Reproducible match results
- Feedback driven scoring updates
- Extensible system design
